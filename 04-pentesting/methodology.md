# Pentesting Methodology (THM/HTB)

This is my general workflow for every machine.

---

## 1) Recon / Scanning
- [ ] Identify target IP
- [ ] Full port scan
```bash
nmap -p- --min-rate 1000 -T4 <ip>
```
* [] Version + scripts scan
```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p <ports> <ip>
```
## 2) Enumeration (Services)
## HTTP/HTTPS
* [] Visit website (check source code)
* [] robots.txt, sitemap.xml
* [] Directory brute force
```bash
ffuf -w <wordlist> -u http://<ip>/FUZZ
```
* [] Burp Suite (intercept, repeat, test)
## SMB
* [] List shares
```bash
sbmclient -L //<ip>/ -N
- [] Enum users/shares
```bash
enum4linux -a <ip>
```
## SSH
* [] Try default creds (only if hints)
* [] Lock for usernames from other services
## 3) Exploitation
* [] Search for known exploits
* [] Try credentials found during enumeration
* [] Upload reverse, shell if possible
* [] Get initial foothold (user shell)
## 4) Privilege Escalation
## Linux
* [] sudo -l
* [] SUID binaries
```bash
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
```
* [] Cron jobs
* [] Writable files/misconfigs
## Windows
* [] Check privileges
* [] Services misconfigs
* [] WinPEAS enumeration
## 5) Loot & Proof
* [] user.txt
* [] root.txt/administartor.txt
* [] Save commands used & findings
## 6) Reporting (important!) 
* [] Vulnerability summary
* [] Steps to reproduce
* [] Fix recommendation
